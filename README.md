# Qc_book_list

## I hope this can help those who want to self-study quantum computing
if any resources link having Copyright / License / Issues please post new issue  
#### few points to address:
1. **please support author, those pdf link can be easily found by googling name only**  
2. **welcome open a new issue for books suggestion and why, no duplicate topic**  
3. **I only recommend those really standsout books, you can read with the order**
